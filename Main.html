<b>Objective:</b>
<p>
Our assignment involved the drawing of an aesthetically beautiful scene with camera functionality for zooming, panning and rolling the camera.
We were not allowed to use textures, so we could rely only on solid colouring, lighting and material properties to lend an aesthetic quality to the scene.
</p>

<b>Why does our assignment stand out?</b>
<p>
Firstly, it's a virtual environment featuring a team member's house based on its design plan.</b>
With some creative licensing, the house is placed on a lawn.</b>
</p>
<p>
Secondly, we additionally implement movement ability for the camera - so you can move forwards, backwards, strafe left and right; much like you would in a First Person shooter. Oh, you can move upwards and downwards too, if that was necessary.
</p>

<b>Details of implementation</b>
<ol>
<li><b>Camera Movement : </b>Global variables tracking the camera position and direction vector are maintained. Simple vector math is used to update the position based on the current direction. Forward, backward and sideways movement is restricted to a 2D plane. Height of this plane can be varied.</li>
<li><b>Camera Manipulation : </b>We allow the camera to pan 360&deg; (both yaw and pitch), roll from -45&deg; to 45&deg; (although it doesn't make a lot of sense here) and zoom in and out varying the field of view angle from 1&deg; to 45&deg;. All this is done by varying global angles representing rotation around the axes. Zooming is implemented by changing the field of view angle in the perspective setup function</li>
<li><b>House drawing : </b>We first wrote elementary functions to draw a wall, door, grill etc. with a given colour and size. We now use this in a <b>push matrix-transform-draw-pop matrix</b> pipeline to avoid cumbersome coordinate computations.
</ol>
